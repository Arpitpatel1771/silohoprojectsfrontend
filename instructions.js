// Table Sorter

// The motivation behind this assignment is to asses a candidate's Javascript (or JQuery) Abilities. The task is an extension to the assignment 3 
// (which was used to test HTML & CSS abilities of a candiate).
// What needs to be done
// Sorting:{
//     "In the given HTML invoice, add a sorter using JavaScript (or JQuery) to sort the invoice table based on the header which was clicked (Description, Qty, Rate & Total Price).On click the table below gets sorted in ascending order and on another click the table get sorted in descending order." = true
// }



// Remove_a_Row:{
//     // On click of any of the green X's (.cross)
//     "remove that row from the invoice" = true,
//     " update total of the invoice" = true
// }

// One important thing needs to be figured out here is that, even and odd rows have formatting difference, that should be preserved 
// (in both the above cases - sorting & remove a row)


// Disable_Remove_a_Row:{
//     // On click of the last header (#toggle_all) one needs to either
//     "remove the column (which has all the green X's)" = false,
//     " Disable any action that takes place when a green X is clicked (Bonus)" = true
// }
